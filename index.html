            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Git?
                <span class="text-muted">A Brief History</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I had never heard of Git before taking this lesson. The video tutorials helped explained to me a little bit about what exactly 'Git' is. Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. The video provided on blackboard dealing with ‘Git’ also spurred me to check out the reading pertaining to its history. From what I learned, Git development began in April of 2005. A man by the name of Linus Torvalds, the creator, wanted a distributed system that he could use like the previous source control management system, and this desire resulted in the eventual ‘Git’ system. Torvald specified three main points related to how Git would work. The first point stated to take CVS (Concurrent Versions System), which I will talk more about in the next topic, as an example of what not to do, and if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision. Without knowing what CVS is, this point can be a little confusing, but it will make more sense after the next highlight is discussed. The next point stated to support a distributed, Bit-Keeper-like workflow. BitKeeper was the previous source control management system. The final point was to include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">VCS
                <span class="text-muted">What does it do?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS, or version control system, is a system that allows for groups of workers, usually developers to view each other's code when unifying together to work on projects etc. VCS, such as Git, allow for each developer to view when another has made changes or edits to code related to the group project, as well as why they made the changes. As explained in the video, Git is a wonderful example of a piece of VCS technology that makes it easier to share and store information with others. VCS is mostly a user-level clustering software, meaning that most of its processes are normal system processes on the systems it operates on, and have no special access to the actual operating system or other functions in the host systems. However, the interconnected, or ‘heartbeat’, technology used with VCS is a proprietary layer-2 Ethernet based protocol that is run in the host space using select modules. The group membership protocol that runs on top of the interconnect heartbeat protocol is also implemented in the host. VCS for Windows is available as a standalone product. It is also sold bundled with Storage Foundation as Storage Foundation HA for Windows; VCS for AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris is supplied as a standalone product. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This key point will dicuss several Git commands. The Git 'commit' command records changes to the repository while Git push-updates remote refs along with associated objects. So the first one is used in connection with your local repository, while the latter one is used to interact with a remote repository. The 'branch' command in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. The default branch name in Git is "master". As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically. The command 'checkout' in Git is used to checkout your desired status of your repository, such as branches. Both Git 'reset' and 'revert' are used to undo commits. Both Git 'merge' and 'rebase' are used to combine branches. In the simplest terms, The 'pull' command does a Git fetch followed by a Git merge. You can do a Git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/. This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without changing your working copy. Although this key point did not highlight every Git command, it covered some of the more basic ones.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Steps</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic will be a bit more hands-on than the last three. It deals in particular with the necessary steps in order to move files into the local repository (Cloud9) and to the remote repository (Github). The first step is simply to create a Github account, as well as a Cloud9 account. While in Cloud9, access the 'settings' tab and click on the 'connected services' button. From there, click 'connect'. Authorize the process and you have officially connected the local and remote repository. Copy the SSH key in the Cloud9 repository and paste it into the 'add SHH key' tab in Github. After doing so, configure your workspace in Cloud9 to be compaatible with Git by entering the necessary commands. Also create a local Git repository by entering several commands. Next, go to Github and create a new repository, select the SSH button, and copy each statement in the "push and existing repository" section. Paste these statements into the Cloud9 terminal. Finally, refresh the Github page and you should see the changes. I did not mention which specific commands to use in the configuration process but they can be accessed online for free. These steps were meant to indicate how to create and connect both local and remote repositories in Cloud9 and Github.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Overview</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first key concept dealt mainly with the history and origin of Git, as well as informational tidbits as to what it does. The other points explained specific functions of Git. This final concept is going to tie everything together. As referenced in the infographic on blackboard, using 'Git Init' in a working directory will initialize the repository. Once in the repository, 'Git Add' will add all of the files that were changed since the last backup to the staging area. From the staging area, "Git Commit -m" commits the changes to repository, and 'Git Push' pushes the changes in the local repository to the remote one. Once in the remote repository, 'Git Pull' pulls the changes in it back to the local repository. Otherwise, 'Git Clone' can be used to clone the locall repository to another folder. Also, 'Git Commit -m', 'Git Add', and 'Git Push' can all be used in the remote repository the same way they were used in the local one. Extraneous commands such as 'Git Log' can be used to show all of the backups created in the repositories. In conclusion, 'Git Diff' shows the differences between the working directory and the backups created in the repository.</p>
